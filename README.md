Before using this example, we need as pre requisites the following:

    - NodeJs 4.x or more recent
    - NPM 3.x or more recent
    - Git (Optional)

Once everything is installed, we need to run the following cmds, in the case we use git, run:

    - git clone git@github.com:malditonekro/shopping-cart.git

Or download the zip by clicking the Download zip option or from the following link:

    - https://github.com/malditonekro/shopping-cart/archive/master.zip

After the previous step:

    - cd shopping-cart

Or open the project folder in the terminal and then run:

    - npm install


### Usage

To be able to serve the shopping cart we need to execute the command

    - npm start

This will serve the project on the port 3000 as specified in the `package.json` file.
If we want to change it we need to open the mentioned file and edit this param `-port 3000` in the `server` script.
